              <h3>Hi there!</h3>
              I am <b>Swati Kumari</b>, hailing from Muzaffarpur, Bihar, with a proud lineage of military service as my father is an ex-army man. This makes me inherently resilient and disciplined, embodying the spirit of a soldier.
    
              My mother is the cornerstone of our home as a dedicated homemaker. I take pride in being a regional level badminton champion, showcasing my dedication and skill in sports. 
    
              Being left-handed sets me apart, and I have a flair for culinary artistry. My strength lies in my ability to embrace rest, allowing me to recharge fully.
    
              However, my trusting nature has been both a strength and a weakness, as it has led to hurt. My ultimate goal is to carve my path as an independent and empowered woman.
